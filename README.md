**Overview:**

This is the day 7 project of the course 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp.


**How It Works:**

It's a hangman game. The computer chooses a word from a list and the user tries to guess the word by picking letters. If he guesses correctly before he runs out of lives, he wins, otherwise he loses.
