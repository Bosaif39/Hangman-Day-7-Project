# **Hangman**

## **Overview:**

This is the Day 7 project from the 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp. The Hangman game allows the user to guess letters of a word chosen randomly by the computer. The player wins by guessing all letters correctly before running out of lives, otherwise, they lose.

## **How It Works:**

1. **Word Selection:** The computer randomly selects a word from a predefined list.
2. **Gameplay:** The user guesses letters to fill in the blanks of the chosen word.
   - If the guessed letter is correct, it is revealed in the word.
   - If the guessed letter is incorrect, the number of lives decreases.
3. **Winning and Losing:** 
   - The user wins if they correctly guess all letters before running out of lives.
   - The user loses if they run out of lives before guessing the word.
